### Custom colors

_If_ you didn't like any of the presets and would like to have custom colors, replace the R, G, B values below and paste it **underneath** the theme's `@import...` line:

```
:root {
    --accent: R, G, B;
    --accent-off: R, G, B;
    --dark: R, G, B;
    --darkest: R, G, B;
    --dark-highlight: R, G, B;
    --dark-apparent: R, G, B;
}
```

**Then** use a color picker on the *background color* anywhere in Settings or Dashboard, set `--dark-apparent` to that value¹, and save it.

### Custom login wallpaper

If you'd like to make your own custom login wallpaper to match the custom colors, in line with the ones I made, follow the instructions in `images/colorschemes/base.svg` _or_ edit the colors to your liking in `images/login-wallpapers/stylish.svg` (use Inkscape). Export and add this following line to Custom CSS:

```
#loginPage {background: url(url-to-your-custom-wallpaper.jpg) !important;}
```

### Custom gradient

To make custom gradients open `images/gradients/coarse-gradients/gradient.ai` in **Adobe Illustrator** (couldn't get one in that shape in Inkscape :/), choose the gradient tool and change all the colors to your `--dark-apparent` including the ones with 0 opacity. Export to PNG with 72 ppi resolution and Art Optimized (Supersampling) anti-aliasing. Then import the output file along with `images/gradients/noise.png` to GIMP or Photoshop (or the template `gradient-noise.xfc`). Then put the noise.png layer _on top_ of the gradient layer and set the blending options of the noise layer to `Multiply`². Export to PNG.

Add the following line to Dashboard > General > Custom CSS as well:

```
.layout-desktop .backgroundContainer {background: url("url-to-your-custom-gradient.png") no-repeat center center;}
```

### Color Breakdown

    --accent: R, G, B;              Light pastel colors will work best.³
    --accent-off: R, G, B;          Darker and less colorful than accent.
    --dark: R, G, B;                Used for some details where a color too dark or too light wouldn't be ideal.
    --darkest: R, G, B;             Used for field's bg, text color when accent/accent-off becomes the bg color, etc.
    --dark-highlight: R, G, B;      Lighter than dark, used for dark highlights. BG in login page, etc.
    --dark-apparent: R, G, B;       Only used in mobile layout. It is the color of the gradient over the backdrop image.

    --white: R, G, B;               Used for the BG of the play button
    --white-off: R, G, B;           Used for the BG of the AppleTV-esque bar

    --jade-green: R, G, B;          Used for watched check
    --honey-yellow: R, G, B;        Used for the rating star color
    --cherry-red: R, G, B;          Used for the shutdown button

### Notes: 
 
 ¹ If you don't do this, the backdrop gradient will not blend perfectly into the background on *mobile*. The background color is affected by the `--accent` color, so `--dark apparent` needs to be calculated for every color combination, hence why I made the presets...

 ² Overlaying the noise onto the gradient exported from Illustrator is necessary to decrease the color banding from the output gradient file. This is an issue with gradients from both Illustrator and Inkscape, and banding looks better if managed with noise. 

 ³ Lighter `--accent` colors work better, as colorful colors will make the background color look very saturated - since the accent color is overlayed on top of the background.

If you are using Zesty color schemes on [Zombie](https://github.com/MakD/zombie-release/tree/main#color-palettes), be aware they will also change your login wallpaper to one of the ones that come with Zesty. If you just want the Zesty colors but not the matching login wallpaper, find a wallpaper you like and add this to the end of your custom CSS:

```
#loginPage {background: url(url-to-your-preferred-wallpaper.jpg) !important;}
```
